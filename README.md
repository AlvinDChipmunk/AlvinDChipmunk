👋 Hi, I’m Alvin H. Revilas(GitHub ID:  @AlvinDChipmunk)

👀 I’m interested in lots of things, like...
<ul>
  <li>Computer programming, including game programming.  Languages and programs used include:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>C++, C, and C#.  Got to use the XNA libraries with C# to make a senior project game.</li>
      <li>JavaScript, with HTML and CSS and PHP</li>
      <li>Java, and right now in a Java Programming boot camp</li>
      <li>Studied and used both Unreal and Unity game engines.  Working on something using Unreal, but first need to buy flight sticks and other controller for that.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Renaissance Faires.  Because of that, I'm involved with:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Choreographing stage combat, both empty handed and with stage weapons</li>
      <li>Medieval European history, via the Renaissance Faire guild I am a part of</li>
      <li>Leatherworking</li>
      <li>Armor making.  I've made at least 4 suits of leather and one of steel metal plate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Model aviation.  Balsa and tissue paper, now brancing out to RC</li>
  <li>Magic tricks.  Will be making a YouTube channel for magic videos eventually</li>
</ul>
