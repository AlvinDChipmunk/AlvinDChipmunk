👋 Hi, I’m Alvin H. Revilas(GitHub ID:  @AlvinDChipmunk)

👀 I’m interested in lots of things, like...
<ul>
  <li>Computer programming, including game programming.  Languages and programs used include:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>C++, C, and C#.  Got to use the XNA libraries with C# to make a senior project game.  Link can be found here:<br />
        <a href="https://github.com/AlvinDChipmunk/FanWoolf">FanWoolf video game</a> (installable on Windows computers)</li>
      <li>JavaScript, with HTML and CSS and PHP</li>
      <li>Java, and right now in a Java Programming boot camp</li>
      <li>Studied and used both Unreal and Unity game engines.  Working on something using Unreal, but first need to buy flight sticks and other controllers for that.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Renaissance Faires.  Because of that, I'm involved with:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Choreographing stage combat, both empty handed and with stage weapons</li>
      <li>Medieval European history, via the Renaissance Faire guild I am a part of</li>
      <li>Leatherworking</li>
      <li>Armor making.  I've made at least 4 suits of leather and one of steel metal plate</li>
      <li>and...Movie making? A friend of a friend needed help, so I've made armor and weapon props for several movie scenes.  
        So, since those were paid gigs, that technically makes me having professional experience in that too.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Model aviation.  Balsa and tissue paper, now brancing out to RC</li>
  <li>Magic tricks.  Will be making a YouTube channel for magic videos eventually</li>
</ul>

🌱 I’m currently (re)learning (because, well, I'm somehow doing lots of things, so gotta review to retain)...
<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>PHP</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>REACT and other frameworks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
